# Creating Effective User Stories

Stories: 
- Designed to be brief to encourage interaction
- High level allows you to defer details: timely and accurate details closer to when you would implement


User-Stories defer design until last responsible moment, not set in stone and are designed to be flexible. 

- Placeholder for conversation
- Reminders for customers and developers to drive timely delivery

Example:
**3 Parts:** 
As a salesperson 
I want to create a quarterly forecast 
So that I shall meet my sales goals



*Focus on what will provide the highest benefit to the customer*
